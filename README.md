#Create Masonry Layout with CSS (Grid with variable-sized contents arranged in columns)

Source code for examples in my article here.

###Grid
  - doesn't handle variable size

###Flex
  - handles variable size
  - need to set the height of container to wrap items into the second column
  - doesn't put the second item in second column, rather put it as the second item in first column
  

###Flex (Firefox)
  - perfect but only in firefox

    
###column-count
  - handles variable size
  - no need to set the height of container to wrap items into the second column 
  - doesn't put the second item in second column, rather put it as the second item in first column
